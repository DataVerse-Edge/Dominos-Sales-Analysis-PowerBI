# DataVerse-Edge-Dominos-Sales-Analysis-PowerBI
This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard built on a Domino’s pizza sales dataset.
The report answers key business questions about revenue, customer behavior, product performance, and time-based trends using interactive visuals and DAX measures.

Dataset
File: Dataset.csv
Granularity: One row per pizza line item (order line) with fields like:
order_id, pizza_name_id, pizza_name
quantity, price
order_date, order_time
pizza_category, pizza_ingredients
​
The data is cleaned and modeled in Power BI to support time intelligence and product-level analysis.
